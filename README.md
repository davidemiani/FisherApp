# FisherApp

The Fisher equation, which combines diffusive motion of individuals with nonlinearities arising from their growth and competition processes, is analyzed, generalized, and applied to the dynamics of bacteria. An user-friendly GUI was designed to run the MATLAB computational model, so that the end users could easily tune the setting parameters and find the most reliable ones.
